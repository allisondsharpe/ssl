Pseudo Code: 

/ Begin PHP /

1) Begin session with ‘session_start()’

2) Call to database using ‘PDO’

3) Use ‘!filter_var’ to filter website field

*Did the user enter a valid website?*

a) If yes, user will be able to add contact and will receive validation message
b) If no, user will receive error message

4) Insert values within each variable using ‘prepare’ 

5) Use ‘bindParam()’ to bind all values submitted by user with variables

! Use ‘execute()’ to execute those values !

6) Use ‘prepare’ once again to select all rows from table ‘contacts’

! Run ‘execute()’ once more !

7) ‘fetchall()’ will return those values to the browser

8) The ‘foreach’ loop will then take those returned values and print them to the browser

9) A ‘delete’ and ‘update’ function will be added using ‘delete.php’ and ‘update.php’
