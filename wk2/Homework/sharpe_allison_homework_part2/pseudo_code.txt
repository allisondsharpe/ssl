Flowchart Outline:


/PHP begins/


1) Create variables for $user and $pass, as well as a variable that will include your SQL database 

2) Create variables for $fruitcolor and $fruitname that will be stored in an array within the method ‘$_POST’

3) Use the ‘prepare’ method to insert values from the form variables into your SQL database

4) Bind your variables for $fruitname and $fruitcolor using bindParam 

5) Once completed, use ‘execute()’ to execute the values for fruitname and fruitcolor into your SQL database

*Is there data within both input fields?*

a) If yes, form will submit

b) If no, form will NOT submit

6) Next, use the ‘prepare’ method once again to select all rows from the ‘fruits’ table within your SQL database

7) Use ‘execute()’ to execute the ‘prepare’ process

8) Use the ‘FETCH_ASSOC’ method to return those selected values for each row

9) The ‘foreach loop’ will print those returned values to the browser

10) The ‘Delete Row’ button will allow you to delete any row within the database
